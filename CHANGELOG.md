## 0.3.0 (October 14, 2014)

FEATURES:

  * **Modules**: Configuration can now be modularized. Modules can live on
    GitHub, BitBucket, Git/Hg repos, HTTP URLs, and file paths. Terraform
    automatically downloads/updates modules for you on request.
  * **New Command: `init`**. This command initializes a Terraform configuration
    from an existing Terraform module (also new in 0.3).
  * **New Command: `destroy`**. This command destroys infrastructure
    created with `apply`.

    provider configurations if they aren't set.
  * `terraform apply MODULE` can be used as a shorthand to quickly build
    infrastructure from a module.
  * The state file format is now JSON rather than binary. This allows for
    easier machine and human read/write. Old binary state files will be
    automatically upgraded.
  * You can now specify `create_before_destroy` as an option for replacement
    so that new resources are created before the old ones are destroyed.

    variables).
  * The current index for a resource with a `count` set can be interpolated
    using `${count.index}`.

    the path to the current module can be interpolated using `${path.module}`.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * providers/aws: Retry deleting subnet for some time while AWS eventually
      destroys dependencies. [GH-357]

      manually. [GH-279]
  * providers/digitalocean: Fix a couple scenarios where the diff was
      incorrect (and therefore the execution as well).

## 0.2.0 (August 28, 2014)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES:

  * We've replaced the configuration language in use from a C library to
    a pure-Go reimplementation. In the process, we removed some features
    of the language since it was too flexible:
    * Semicolons are no longer valid at the end of lines
    * Keys cannot be double-quoted strings: `"foo" = "bar"` is no longer
      valid.
    * JSON style maps `{ "foo": "bar" }` are no longer valid outside of JSON.
      Maps must be in the format of `{ foo = "bar" }` (like other objects
      in the config)
  * Heroku apps now require (will not validate without) `region` and
    `name` due to an upstream API change. [GH-239]

FEATURES:

  * **New Provider: `google`**: Manage Google Compute instances, disks,
      firewalls, and more.
  * **New Provider: `mailgun`**: Manage mailgun domains.
  * **New Function: `concat`**: Concatenate multiple strings together.
    Example: `concat(var.region, "-", var.channel)`.

      attributes.
  * providers/aws: Security group rules can be updated without a
      destroy/create.

      to the user's home directory. [GH-179]
  * core: The `file()` function can load files in sub-directories. [GH-213]
  * core: Fix issue where some JSON structures didn't map properly into
     Terraform structures. [GH-177]

  * core: Variables work in block names. [GH-234]
  * core: Plugins are searched for in the same directory as the executable
      before the PATH. [GH-157]

  * providers/aws: Fix issues around failing to read EIPs. [GH-122]
  * providers/aws: Autoscaling groups now register and export load
    balancers. [GH-207]

      operation is in progress [GH-183]

  * providers/heroku: If you delete the `config_vars` block, config vars
      are properly nuked.
  * providers/heroku: Domains and drains are deleted before the app.
  * providers/heroku: Moved from the client library bgentry/heroku-go to
      cyberdelia/heroku-go [GH-239].
  * providers/heroku: Plans without a specific plan name for
      heroku\_addon work. [GH-198]

PLUGIN CHANGES:

  * **New Package:** `helper/schema`. This introduces a high-level framework
    for easily writing new providers and resources. The Heroku provider has
    been converted to this as an example.
